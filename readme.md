## 1. Installation

1. **Download or clone the repository:**
   - Download and unzip the repository

2. **Set the path in MATLAB:**
   - Use the respective command in MATLAB to set the path to the `Code/` folder

---

## 2. Quick Start

After installing and setting the path, you can immediately run the example scripts provided:
1. Run any script to reproduce a figure or experiment:
   - Go to the `Examples/` folder and run any script locally or in MATLAB Online
   - Be careful: You may need to add this line of code at the start of your script so the file has access to the functions that exist in the `Code` folder:

     ```matlab
     addpath('/path/to/Code');
     ```

2. Each example script is referenced in the report and will reproduce the corresponding experiment or figure.
3. Note: If you run the scripts locally on your desktop, you may need to explicitly import some helper functions from matlab. If you run it in Matlab online, there shouldn't be any problems.

## 3. Report

1. The `Report` folder contains a comprehensive PDF report (`report.pdf`) with:
   1. Full explanation of the problem and methods
   2. All required background and references
